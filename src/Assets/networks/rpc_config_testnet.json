The aim of every one of these six artworks is to make the new owner just take a small break and ponder about one of those topics, as well as admire their influence on the surrounding world. I chose the form factor of a surreal museum-like space, because ever since I was a small child, I thought about modern art galleries as the calm, quiet places designed to let the observer admire and reflect upon the odd, non-conventional and often controversial concepts. I hope that events taking place in this little space I designed in my head will succeed in their goal.",

Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 ‘Rare Heart Hodler’ NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",

Growing up I self-taught to become an equestrian rider. I have also judged equestrian events and competitions and organized charity festivals in support of children with disabilities. \n\nRiding horses can be very healing for children and their psycho-emotional state and for those who become more involved, assists with muscle development. I used to coach children for free but have retired from this. However, I keep in close contact with the equestrian club in my hometown and occasionally still assist by running the group classes for children. I also financially support and support them with media coverage, assisting with fund raising to help kids receive this amazing and free therapy with horses.\n\nTo support the equestrian club and children, I am auctioning a limited-edition 1:1 ‘Rare Heart Hodler’ NFT. It also comes with a T-shirt and an autographed card from myself. Additionally, 10 holders of the 'Heart Hodler' from the open edition will be randomly selected to receive a physical autographed card from myself",
